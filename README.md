# Word_counter_React
In my React-based word counting project, I utilize JavaScript and CSS. The page enables data input with buttons for transforming text to lowercase, uppercase, or clearing it. A preview displays modified data, and the system calculates word and alphabet counts, estimating reading time for a specified word.
